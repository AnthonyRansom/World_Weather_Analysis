# World_Weather_Analysis
 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Within this project there are 3 small applications that provide information for planning a trip itinerary
- The first application is the Weather Database application that generates random latitude and longitude locations around the world
	and presents a list of cities along with writing the list to a csv file.
	
- The Vacation Search application allows a user to input the Fahrenheit temperature range to filter the list of cities
	generated by the Weather Database application to a list of cities that meet the temperature criteria and display a google maps
	image of all the cities that meet the criteria and outputs the filtered list to a csv file.
	
- The Vacation itinerary application will provide a map with driving directions for 4 locations in the same country from the Vacation Search application.

## HOW TO

### config.py file for API keys
A config.py file containing the relevant API keys will need to be placed in each of the folders containing the various projects  
The below shows the required API key formatting required for each config.py file

- Weather_Database folder:
	- config.py API key entry:  
		weather_api_key="replace with API key from OpenWeatherMap"
		
- Vacation_Search folder:
	- config.py API key entry:
		g_key="replace with API key from Googleapi"
